Feature: Lobbies can be password protected

  Background:
    Given the "signaling" backend is running


  Scenario: Players can create password protected lobbies and join them
    Given "blue" is connected as "1u8fw4aph5ypt" and ready for game "4307bd86-e1df-41b8-b9df-e22afcf084bd"
    And "yellow" is connected as "h5yzwyizlwao" and ready for game "4307bd86-e1df-41b8-b9df-e22afcf084bd"
    And "blue" creates a lobby with these settings:
      """json
      {
        "password": "foobar"
      }
      """
    And "blue" receives the network event "lobby" with the argument "19yrzmetd2bn7"

    When "yellow" connects to the lobby "19yrzmetd2bn7" with the password "foobar"
    Then "yellow" receives the network event "lobby" with the argument "19yrzmetd2bn7"


  Scenario: No password will not allow a player to join a lobby
    Given "blue" is connected as "1u8fw4aph5ypt" and ready for game "4307bd86-e1df-41b8-b9df-e22afcf084bd"
    And "yellow" is connected as "h5yzwyizlwao" and ready for game "4307bd86-e1df-41b8-b9df-e22afcf084bd"
    And "blue" creates a lobby with these settings:
      """json
      {
        "password": "foobar"
      }
      """
    And "blue" receives the network event "lobby" with the argument "19yrzmetd2bn7"

    When "yellow" tries to connect to the lobby "19yrzmetd2bn7" without a password
    Then "yellow" failed to join the lobby
    And the latest error for "yellow" is "invalid password"


  Scenario: A wrong password will not allow a player to join a lobby
    Given "blue" is connected as "1u8fw4aph5ypt" and ready for game "4307bd86-e1df-41b8-b9df-e22afcf084bd"
    And "yellow" is connected as "h5yzwyizlwao" and ready for game "4307bd86-e1df-41b8-b9df-e22afcf084bd"
    And "blue" creates a lobby with these settings:
      """json
      {
        "password": "foobar"
      }
      """
    And "blue" receives the network event "lobby" with the argument "19yrzmetd2bn7"

    When "yellow" tries to connect to the lobby "19yrzmetd2bn7" with the password "wrong"
    Then "yellow" failed to join the lobby
    And the latest error for "yellow" is "invalid password"


  Scenario: You can change the password
    Given "yellow" is connected as "1u8fw4aph5ypt" and ready for game "4307bd86-e1df-41b8-b9df-e22afcf084bd"
    And "yellow" creates a lobby with these settings:
      """json
      {
        "public": true,
        "password": "foobar"
      }
      """
    And "yellow" receives the network event "lobby" with the argument "h5yzwyizlwao"

    When "yellow" requests lobbies with this filter:
      """json
      {}
      """
    Then "yellow" should have received only these lobbies:
      | code         | hasPassword |
      | h5yzwyizlwao | true        |

    When "yellow" updates the lobby with these settings:
      """json
      {
        "password": ""
      }
      """
    And "yellow" requests lobbies with this filter:
      """json
      {}
      """
    Then "yellow" should have received only these lobbies:
      | code         | hasPassword |
      | h5yzwyizlwao | false       |


  Scenario: Players can add a password to a lobby and join it
    Given "blue" is connected as "1u8fw4aph5ypt" and ready for game "4307bd86-e1df-41b8-b9df-e22afcf084bd"

    And "blue" receives the network event "lobby" with the argument "19yrzmetd2bn7"

    When "blue" updates the lobby with these settings:
      """json
      {
        "password": "blabla"
      }
